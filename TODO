TODO
* To create accurate face map:
  x Calculate average face size
  x Ditch any face that is 50% or below avg face size
  * Starting at 1st frame, loop through faces and find closest face in next frame
    * If face is within 2/3 face size of previous face, assume it's the same face
    * If no match found in next frame, try following frame and so on
    * If a match is found, connect them, null out current face, then repeat on new face until end

  * If a face has fewer than a threshold of recognition, remove it
  * Fill in the blanks with iterative movement between last known location and previous known location

* Adjust sequence to display size (so, for example, green rectangle scales to video)


DONE
